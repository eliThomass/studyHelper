======== HELP =========
File format: JSON
    Formatting: { term:definition, term:definition, etc. }
    If the data file is not in this format, unexpected behavior will occur!
    
1: Flashcards
     Use Q and E to cycle through cards. Use spacebar to flip cards.

2: List all terms
     Lists all terms in the data file
	
3: List all terms (timed)
     Lists all terms in the data file, but adds a timer in between printing each term.
     This helps with readability, rather than dumping all terms on screen at once.
     When prompted, enter a positive integer.

4: List terms by chapter
     If JSON file is formatted with chapters, you can choose a chapter to print the terms of.
     Formatting: { chapter : {term:definition, term:definition, etc.}, chapter : {etc.}}
     If not in this formatting, you will not be able to list terms by chapter.
     Be sure to use the EXACT chapter name which is in the data file when using the program.
     Using a short name for the chapters such as '1', etc. is suggested.

Additional
     It is recommended to have your terminal be at least 100 characters in width.
     This will reduce line wrapping.
