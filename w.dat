  "Firewall Characteristics": "Design goals include ensuring all traffic passes through the firewall, allowing only authorized traffic based on security policies, and making the firewall immune to compromise.",
  "Firewall Access Policy": "A critical component in firewall implementation that specifies authorized traffic types, including address ranges, protocols, applications, and content types. It is based on an organization's security risk assessment and policies.",
  "Firewall Filter Characteristics": "Firewalls filter traffic using characteristics such as IP address and protocol values, application protocols, user identity, and network activity.",
  "Firewall Capabilities": "Defines a single choke point, monitors security events, and serves as a platform for Internet functions such as IP Sec. Provides a location for monitoring security events.",
  "Firewall Limitations": "Cannot protect against attacks that bypass the firewall, may not fully protect against internal threats, and improper configuration or unsecured devices can lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "Packet Filtering Firewall": "A firewall that applies rules to each incoming and outgoing IP packet, typically based on IP or TCP header information, forwarding or discarding packets based on rules.",
  "Stateful Inspection Firewall": "Tightens rules for TCP traffic by tracking established connections. Only allows incoming traffic to high-numbered ports if it matches an entry in the connection directory.",
  "Application-Level Gateway": "Also known as an application proxy, it acts as a relay for application-level traffic and requires proxy code for each application. It is more secure than packet filters but has additional overhead.",
  "Circuit-Level Gateway": "Sets up two TCP connections—one between the gateway and an internal host, and one between the gateway and an external host—relaying TCP segments without inspecting the contents.",
  "SOCKS Circuit-Level Gateway": "Defined in RFC 1928, provides a framework for client-server applications in TCP/UDP domains to securely use the services of a network firewall.",
  "Bastion Hosts": "A system identified as a critical strong point in the network’s security, serving as a platform for application-level or circuit-level gateways. Typically runs a secure OS and only essential services.",
  "Host-Based Firewalls": "Firewalls used to secure an individual host, available in operating systems or as add-ons, providing filtering and restricting packet flows tailored to the host environment.",
  "Personal Firewall": "Controls traffic between a personal computer and the Internet or enterprise network. Typically a software module on a personal computer, used for both home and corporate environments.",
  "Firewall Topologies": "Includes various configurations such as host-resident firewalls, screening routers, single or double bastion inlines, and distributed firewall configurations.",
  "Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)": "An extension of IDS that attempts to block or prevent detected malicious activity. Can be host-based, network-based, or distributed/hybrid, using anomaly or signature/heuristic detection.",
  "Host-Based IPS (HIPS)": "Can detect and block malicious behavior such as system resource modification, privilege escalation, buffer overflow, and access to email contacts. Can be tailored to specific platforms.",
  "Network-Based IPS (NIPS)": "An inline NIDS with authority to modify or discard packets and tear down TCP connections, using methods like pattern matching, stateful matching, protocol anomaly, and traffic anomaly.",
  "Digital Immune System": "A comprehensive defense system developed by IBM and refined by Symantec, designed to detect and prevent malware by monitoring and responding to global malware threats.",
  "Snort Inline": "Enables Snort to function as an intrusion prevention system, allowing users to modify or drop packets. It includes a 'replace' option to modify packets, useful for honeypot implementations.",
  "Unified Threat Management (UTM)": "A security solution that integrates multiple security features such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and antivirus into a single appliance.",

  "Buffer Overflow": "A condition at an interface under which more input can be placed into a buffer or data holding area than the capacity allocated, overwriting other information. Adversaries exploit such a condition to crash a system or to insert specially crafted code that allows them to gain control of the system.",  
  "Stack Buffer Overflow": "Occurs when a buffer is located on the stack, also referred to as stack smashing. Exploits included an unchecked buffer overflow and are still widely used in attacks.",  
  "Shellcode": "Code supplied by an attacker, often saved in the buffer being overflowed. Traditionally transfers control to a user command-line interpreter (shell). Modern tools automate shellcode generation.",  
  "Heap Overflow": "An attack in which the buffer is located in the heap, typically above program code. Heap memory is used for dynamic data structures.",  
  "Programming Language History": "Modern high-level languages have a strong notion of type and valid operations and are not vulnerable to buffer overflows, unlike languages such as C, which allow direct memory access.",  
  "Stack Frame": "A data structure that contains function parameters, return addresses, and local variables. When one function calls another, a stack frame is used to save these values.",  
  "Compile-Time Defenses": "Techniques used during the compilation of code to prevent buffer overflows, such as the use of modern high-level programming languages, safe coding techniques, and stack protection mechanisms like canaries.",  
  "Run-Time Defenses": "Techniques used to detect and abort buffer overflow attacks during program execution. Examples include making regions of memory non-executable and using address space randomization.",  
  "Random Canary": "A value inserted into the stack which, if changed, indicates a buffer overflow attack, allowing the program to abort.",  
  "Guard Pages": "Special memory regions placed between critical areas of memory to prevent buffer overflows from affecting adjacent memory. They are flagged as illegal addresses, and any attempt to access them aborts the process.",  
  "Return to System Call": "A variant of a stack overflow attack that replaces the return address with a standard library function. This technique was developed in response to non-executable stack defenses.",  
  "Replacement Stack Frame": "A variant of a buffer overflow that overwrites the saved frame pointer value to redirect control to a dummy stack frame containing the attacker's shellcode.",  
  "Off-by-One Attack": "A coding error where one more byte is copied than the space available, leading to buffer overflow.",  
  "Libsafe": "A dynamic library that replaces unsafe C standard library functions with safer variants to prevent buffer overflows.",

  "Executable Address Space Protection": "A run-time defense where regions of memory are marked non-executable to prevent code execution from buffers.",  
  "Address Space Randomization": "A technique that randomizes the location of key data structures like the stack, heap, and libraries in memory to make buffer overflow attacks more difficult."
