File format: JSON
    Formatting: { term:definition, term:definition, etc. }
    OR: 		{ chapter: { term:def, term:def, etc.}, chapter : { term:def, etc.}, etc.}
    If the data file isn't in one of these formats, unexpected behavior will occur!
    
1: Flashcards
     Use Q and E to cycle through cards. Use spacebar to flip cards.

2: List all terms
     Lists all terms in the data file
	
3: List all terms (timed)
     Lists all terms in the data file, but adds a timer in between printing each term.
     This helps with readability, rather than dumping all terms on screen at once.
     When prompted, enter a positive number.

4: List terms by chapter
     If JSON file is formatted with chapters, you can select a chapter to print.
     Be sure to use the EXACT chapter name which is in the data file when using the program.
     Using a short name for the chapters such as '1', etc. is suggested.
     
5: List terms by chapter (timed)
	If JSON file is formatted with chapters, you can select a chapter to print.
	You can then select a time to add a small delay between printing each term.
	

Additional
     It is recommended to have your terminal be at least 100 characters in width.
     This will reduce line wrapping.
